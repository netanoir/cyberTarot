                    “Tarot for me is like a really cool way to get clarity. My granny on 
                    my dad's side was a really powerful rootworker. So I'm like, ‘Okay 
                    it's already there. Let me just go ahead and tap into it.’ And for me, 
                    liberation work is very spiritual as a black woman. So it's really 
                    important that I have a strong political and spiritual foundation, and 
                    tarot helps me do that.”

            <p> The tarot first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi 
                or tarock is a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century 
                in various parts of the world. In the late 18th century, some tarot 
                packs began to be used as a tool for divination via tarot card reading 
                and cartomancy leading to custom packs developed for such occult 
                purposes.
